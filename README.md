# Models

- [[Bert4RE]]([Retraining a BERT Model for Transfer Learning in Requirements Engineering: A Preliminary Study | IEEE Conference Publication | IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9920081)) - This is a RE domain-specific LM [59] which was trained on the BERTbase model using more than seven million words from different RE-related datasets.

# Datasets

- [SmartHomeDataset](https://crowdre.github.io/murukannaiah-smarthome-requirements-dataset/) - smart home requirements created by 300 workers. There are 2966 requirements in total with each requirement being expressed as a user story.

- [ReqEval](https://github.com/frieden84/nlp4re-reqeval) - a dataset for anaphora ambiguity detection and disambiguation.

- [DAMIR](https://gitlab.uni.lu/sabualhaija/anaphoric-ambiguity) - a dataset for anaphora ambiguity detection and disambiguation.

- [PROMISE NFR](https://zenodo.org/record/268542) - a dataset for requirement classfication(FRs vs NFRs)

- [SecReq dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/4530183) - a dataset for requirement classfication(security-related vs non-security)
